### Focus
I work on applied machine learning systems with an emphasis on computer vision and on-device inference.  
My interests sit at the intersection of biometric security, identity verification, and responsible AI.

---

### What I’m Working On
- Face liveness detection and anti-spoofing (mobile, passive)
- Face matching and biometric pipelines
- OCR systems for Arabic and mixed-script identity documents
- Lightweight ML models designed for real-world constraints

---

### Technical Background
- **Machine Learning:** PyTorch, ONNX, CoreML, scikit-learn  
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV, image preprocessing, face analysis  
- **Data:** Python, SQL, Pandas, Excel  
- **Deployment:** Mobile on-device inference, model optimization  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, Jupyter

---

### Perspective
I focus on building systems that are:
- Practical and deployable
- Privacy-aware and policy-realistic
- Designed for production, not just research demos
